        <p>Born and raised in Venezuela, I am a senior at the School of Communication in the University of Miami set to graduate in May 2017. My majors are Broadcast Journalism and Public Relations. With a passion for entertainment, traveling and politics, I am a news anchor and reporter for Unimiami and Enterate.  These are Spanish news shows presented on Emmy- award winning student-run cable station, UMTV (University of Miami TV Station). In addition, have worked at Univision Communications Inc. The most watched Hispanic TV network in the United States. As a production intern, I was able to be part of live TV shows such as Noticiero Univision, Al Punto, Primer Impacto and Noticias 23.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Working as a technical director, anchor, reporter, production and camera assistant, has allowed me to strengthen my journalism skills - investigative and production field work as well as the ability to work with diverse groups of people and under pressure.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I have a strong knowledge of Latin American culture. I have lived in both Venezuela and Costa Rica which has provided me with exposure and understanding of different Latin American regions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In the future, I am looking forward to be an outstanding journalist in the Hispanic industry so I will continue hesitant to reach my goals.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I hope you can enjoy some pieces of my work shown in this website. All the videos and stories have been written, produced and shoot by me.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Welcome and enjoy!
